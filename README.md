This is a modpack put together by me, GreenBean, to allow blind Minecraft players to play the game. It contains full instruction, installers, and mods needed to play the game for the visually impaired community. You may use this pack however you like. If you choose to distribute it, make sure to give credit to the mod developers. The sole purpose of this modpack is to make the game fully playable by blind gamers.

AudioAccess contains mods like Accessibility Plus and Easy Life that aid the ability of blind players to play Minecraft. Some examples of the features that are offered are:

 

Block Narration

Entity Narration

Inventory Narration and navigation

Combat accessibility

Coordinate Narration

Health/Hunger narration

 

Disclaimer:

 

THE MODS IN THIS PACK ARE NOT CREATED BY ME. If you want to suggest things that should be added to the modpack, contact "Shoaib#9319" or "luissanchezdev#6247" on Discord via these Discord servers:
